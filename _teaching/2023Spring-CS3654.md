Course Description: Basic principles and techniques in data analytics; methods for the collection of, storing, accessing, and manipulating standard-size and large datasets; data visualization; and identifying sources of bias.

In my role as an undergraduate teaching assistant, I facilitated academic discussions by conducting office hours, offering guidance and support to fellow students in resolving course-related issues. Additionally, I collaborated with Graduate Teaching Assistants on course homework and monitored online discussion forums to ensure active participation and engagement amongst the students.
