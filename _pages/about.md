In May, 2023, I will be awarded a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), where I am enrolled in the Accelerated BS/MS Program under the guidance of my advisor, [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/). My research interests primarily focus on leveraging interactive visualizations of data to facilitate decision-making and enable machines to perform tasks that traditionally necessitate human intelligence.
