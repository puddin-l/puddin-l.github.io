In May 2023, I will be awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). Currently, I am enrolled in the Accelerated BS/MS Program, pursuing an MSc thesis in Computer Science & Applications under the guidance of my advisor, [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/). My research interests primarily revolve around leveraging interactive visualizations of data to facilitate decision-making and equip machines with the ability to perform tasks that conventionally require human intelligence.
